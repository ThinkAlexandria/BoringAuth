## Pull requests

When submitting code, please follow the following guidelines:

- report any remarkable change in the change log ;
- document every publicly accessible item (module, function, â€¦) with [rustdoc](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/documentation.html) and insert examples ;
- write unit tests that checks your code is working well ;
- for bug-fixes, write unit tests showing the corrected bug ;
- for new features, do not forget to create the C-bindings ;
- yes, unit tests have to be written for C-bindings too ;
- **launch the test suite before submitting your code**, obviously every single test have to pass.

## Coding style

- Indent code with 4 spaces ;
- no trailing whitespace at the end of lines ;
- use descriptive variable names ;
- functions should be as short as possible, do only one thing and do it well ;
- prefer `match` over `if`.

In a more general way, if you feel your code doesn't look like the project's one, fix it.
